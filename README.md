# Student Performance Analysis

The success of an education system is generally determined by students’ academic
achievement which could be affected by various factors in a modern complex environment.
Analyzing students’ work and understanding antecedents of students’ learning performance, thus,
are challenging and crucial to academic institutions as they would help educators in acknowledging
students’ difficulties and building intervention plans to overcome students’ studying problems,
which consequently improves teaching quality. Therefore, the purpose of this current project is to
investigate determinants of students’ academic performance by considering a series of factors such
as gender, parents’ education level, test preparation, and students’ lunch meal. To specify, this
project aims to address the following questions:

1. Whether the performance of female students significantly differs from that of male ones
on average.
2. Whether the students’ learning performance varies across the ethnic groups.
3. Whether the level of education of parents predicts students’ academic achievement.
4. Whether test preparation plays a critical role in improving students’ performance.
5. Whether there is any difference in academic performance of students who have free
lunch versus those who have the standard meal.

To meet the abovementioned objectives, this project has conducted a statistical procedure.
First, the original data set has been transformed by recoding categorical values of nominal
variables to numeric forms. Second, an exploratory data analysis has been performed to identify
the visual discrepancies in three exam scores and overall scores of students among considered
groups. Finally, the project estimates a multiple linear regression model to test the initial findings
in the previous step. Although the statistical results may be limited within the utilized data set,
they still provide practical solutions for educators and institutions in their understanding of
students’ difficulties during their study and strategic plan to enhance education quality.
Additionally, this project's findings also offer suggestions for future analysis to improve students’
academic achievement.
